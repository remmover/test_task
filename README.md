## Introduction

This project aims to create an HTTP service that interacts with a database. It offers a JSON API to perform operations on the database. It utilizes FastAPI for building the API, SQLAlchemy for database operations, Poetry for dependency management, Sphinx for documentation, and unittests for testing.

## Features

- **User Credits Information**: Retrieve information about a user's credits, including issuance date, closed status, return date, issuance amount, accrued interest, and payment details.
- **Upload Plans**: Upload Excel files containing plans for the next month, ensuring data integrity and preventing duplicates.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/remmover/test_task
.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd test_task
   ```

3. Install project dependencies using Poetry:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

## Usage

To use the application:

### Running the Application

You can run the application using Uvicorn:

```bash
uvicorn your_app_module:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

Replace `your_app_module` with the actual module name containing your FastAPI app.

### API Endpoints

- **/user_credits/{user_id}**: Retrieve information about a user's credits.

  Example:
  
  ```bash
  GET /user_credits/123
  ```

- **/plans_insert**: Upload plans for the next month.

  Example:

  ```bash
  POST /plans_insert
  ```

## Documentation

For detailed documentation, visit [Documentation](link-to-documentation). The documentation is generated using Sphinx.

## Testing

To run unit tests, use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

## Deployment

Deploy the FastAPI application to a production server. Ensure that you have the necessary server requirements and configurations in place.
